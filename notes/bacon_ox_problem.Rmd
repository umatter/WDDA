## Introduction

- Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911) was an English Victorian polymath and statistician
- Known for his work in statistics, psychology, and anthropology
- Observed a fascinating phenomenon at a country fair that would later influence modern statistical thinking

## The Ox Market Problem

```

**Galton's Observation**: At a country fair in Plymouth in 1906, Galton observed a contest where participants guessed the weight of an ox.

## The Surprising Result

- No individual guessed the exact weight of the ox
- However, when Galton calculated the average (median) of all guesses, it was remarkably close to the actual weight
- Galton published his findings in the journal Nature in a 1907 article titled "Vox Populi" (The Voice of the People)

## Mathematical Representation

If we have $n$ individual guesses $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, then:

$$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i$$

Galton observed that $\bar{x} \approx$ true weight

In his actual study, Galton found the median of 787 guesses was 1,207 pounds, while the true weight was 1,198 pounds - an error of less than 1%.

```{r}
# Simulate data for illustration
set.seed(123)
true_weight <- 1198
guesses <- rnorm(100, mean = true_weight, sd = 120)
mean_guess <- mean(guesses)
```

## Visualizing the Phenomenon

```{r, fig.height=4}
df <- data.frame(guess = guesses)
ggplot(df, aes(x = guess)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50, fill = "skyblue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = true_weight, color = "red", size = 1.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_guess, color = "blue", size = 1.5, linetype = "dashed") +
  annotate("text", x = true_weight + 70, y = 20, label = "True Weight", color = "red") +
  annotate("text", x = mean_guess - 70, y = 20, label = "Mean Guess", color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Guesses vs. True Weight",
       x = "Weight (kg)",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Modern Applications: Wisdom of Crowds

- James Surowiecki's 2004 book "The Wisdom of Crowds" popularized this concept
- Key conditions for crowd wisdom:
  - Diversity of opinion
  - Independence of judgments
  - Decentralization
  - Aggregation mechanism

## Statistical Explanation

- Individual errors tend to cancel each other out
- Some people overestimate, others underestimate
- The average converges toward the true value
- This is related to the Law of Large Numbers

## Example from Our Data

```{r}
# Create a small table of sample guesses
set.seed(456)
sample_guesses <- sample(guesses, 10)
sample_df <- data.frame(
  Participant = 1:10,
  Guess = round(sample_guesses),
  Error = round(sample_guesses - true_weight)
)

# Display summary statistics instead of a table
cat("Summary of sample guesses:\n")
cat("Mean guess:", round(mean(sample_guesses)), "kg\n")
cat("True weight:", true_weight, "kg\n")
cat("Error of mean:", round(mean(sample_guesses) - true_weight), "kg\n")
```

## Applications in Modern Statistics

- Ensemble methods in machine learning
- Polling and survey aggregation
- Prediction markets
- Delphi method for expert consensus

## Limitations and Considerations

- The crowd needs to be knowledgeable about the subject
- Independence is crucial (avoiding groupthink)
- Systematic biases can skew the collective judgment
- Outliers can significantly impact small samples

## Classroom Exercise

Consider our dataset from WDDA_03.xlsx:

- The variable `jar` contains guesses about the number of M&Ms in a jar
- The true count was 405 M&Ms
- How close is the mean of all guesses to the true value?
- Does this support Bacon's observation?

## Conclusion

- Galton's observation was remarkably important for statistical thinking
- It demonstrates how collective judgment can outperform individual expertise
- This principle underpins many modern statistical and decision-making approaches
- A beautiful example of how empirical observations can lead to profound insights
